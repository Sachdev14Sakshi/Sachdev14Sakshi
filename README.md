Hi, I'm Sakshi Sachdev 👋 — a Software Engineer at Oracle in California 🌉. My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion for building impactful systems. From academic foundations to real-world engineering, I've developed strong interests in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud technologies ☁️.

🎓 During my Master’s, I developed a mobile and web-based participatory sensing platform that allowed domain scientists to define Areas of Interest (AOIs) and notify volunteers for geo-tagged data collection. I implemented a location-aware caching and prefetching algorithm to optimize system performance across varied mobile devices. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and Accenture Research Labs, and was published in Springer: https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-30146-0_15

💼 I began my career at Hughes Network Systems as a Full Stack Developer, building real-time monitoring tools using Java, Spring, Hibernate, JavaScript, jQuery, and Python, with deployments on Tomcat clusters behind Nginx.

🚀 In March 2021, I joined Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI), where I focused on backend development for large-scale distributed systems, automating hardware repair workflows, and improving infrastructure performance.

🏥 Recently, I transitioned to Oracle Health, where I’m part of a team building healthcare applications from scratch—transforming monolithic legacy systems into modern, cloud-native solutions. This role has helped me deepen my skills in:

🛠️ System architecture and service design

☁️ Cloud-native development and migrations

🧩 Solving complex engineering problems

💻 What Drives Me
⚙️ System Design & Cloud Engineering

☁️ Cloud-Native Transformations

🧠 Scalable, Maintainable Software

🔒 Security & Performance Optimization

Working at the intersection of cloud infrastructure and healthcare tech has shown me the tangible impact of engineering on lives and systems at scale.
