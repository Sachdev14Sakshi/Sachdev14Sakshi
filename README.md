Hi, I'm Sakshi Sachdev 👋 — a Software Engineer at Oracle in California 🌉. My journey in tech has been driven by curiosity, continuous learning, and a passion for building impactful systems. From academic foundations to real-world engineering, I've developed strong interests in backend development, distributed systems, and cloud technologies ☁️.

🎓 During my Master’s, I developed a mobile and web-based participatory sensing platform that allowed domain scientists to define Areas of Interest (AOIs) and notify volunteers for geo-tagged data collection. I implemented a location-aware caching and prefetching algorithm to optimize system performance across varied mobile devices. This work was supported by the National Science Foundation and Accenture Research Labs, and was published in Springer:
