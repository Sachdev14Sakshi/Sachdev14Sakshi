## 💡 About Me

I'm a Software Engineer based in California 🌉. My journey in tech has been driven by **curiosity**, **continuous learning**, and a passion for building impactful systems. From **academic foundations to real-world engineering**, I’ve developed strong interests in:

- Backend Development  
- Distributed Systems  
- Cloud Technologies ☁️

## 🎓 Master's Thesis

During my Master’s, I developed a **mobile and web-based participatory sensing platform** that allowed domain scientists to define **Areas of Interest (AOIs)** and notify volunteers for geo-tagged data collection. I implemented a **location-aware caching and prefetching algorithm** to optimize system performance across varied mobile devices.

📖 This research was supported by the **National Science Foundation** and **Accenture Research Labs**, and was **published in Springer**:
